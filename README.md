# mri_radiomics_her2breast_expression

This repository contains the radiomics and machine learning code associated with the study by Ramtohul et al. published in Radiology (Multiparametric MRI and radiomics for the prediction of HER2-zero, -low and -positive breast cancers. Radiology. 2023).

This work is largerly based on contributions and Python packages developed by others and reported previously, mainly:

pyradiomics (van Griethuysen et al. Computational Radiomics System to Decode the Radiographic Phenotype. Cancer Research, 77(21), e104–e107. 2017)
scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python. JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830. 2011)
